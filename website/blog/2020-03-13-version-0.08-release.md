[Full Changelog](https://github.com/sting-ioc/sting/compare/v0.07...v0.08)

Changes in this release:

* Add some basic documentation on the following topics:
  - Accessing services managed by the injector
* Enhance the error message on unresolved injectors to suggest using the `sting.debug` annotation processor option.
* Add significantly more debug logging to the annotation processor to simplify tracking down unresolved injector errors.
* Ensure that the processor will correct defer an injector to a later round if a transitive include of an `@Injectable` type has not been generated yet but is expected to be generated by another annotation processor.
