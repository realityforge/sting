# Assets

This directory contains the assets used when building the  Sting documentation iconography. Each directory
contains assets and their providence is described below.

## dot_legend

The `legend.gv` file was hand written and then `legend.gv` was generated by running `dot -Tsvg -o legend.svg legend.gv`
and cleaning up the resultant svg in an editor and aligning lines.

## favicons

The favicons were generated by the [Favicon Generator](https://www.favicon-generator.org/) tool.

## icons

* **logo.***: These icons were found on a free svg icon website with no public domain "license". The icons were then massaged in a series of svg authoring programs.
